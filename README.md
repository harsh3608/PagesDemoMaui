Multi-platform
.NET MAUI uses the latest technologies for building native apps on Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android, abstracting them into one common framework built on .NET.


One codebase
Use a single C# codebase and project system for all device targets to build apps that look and feel like the native platforms.


Productive
Build beautiful apps faster and easier by integrating the power of Visual Studio with .NET MAUI.
